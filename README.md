## Description

This is portfolio application that was developed to showcase my full stack developer skills. It was created using React.js, an open sourced JavaScript library for building user interfaces, Bootstrap, and Font Awesome, for future development of the hamburger menu for smaler devices. React was created by Facebook developers and helps simplify the process of building UI by providing a component-based structure, efficient rendering through virtual DOM, and a declarative syntax.
